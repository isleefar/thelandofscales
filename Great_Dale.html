<p>
Great Dale is the name given to the massive forested region and bordering mountains in the central North of the Land of Scales. The word "dale" means a low, broad valley ringed with steep mountains, and dales are thought to be great impact craters (as is the case with <a href="./Arcanva_Dale.html" title="Arcanva Dale" class="page">Arcanva Dale</a>). Within the Great Dale are four independent but related civilizations: <a href="./Overdale.html" title="Overdale" class="page">Overdale</a>, <a href="./Underdale.html" title="Underdale" class="page">Underdale</a>, <a href="./Shining_on_the_Sea.html" title="Shining on the Sea" class="page">Shining on the Sea</a>, and <a href="./Shadow_by_the_Boughs.html" title="Shadow by the Boughs" class="page">Shadow by the Boughs</a>, all of which are ancestrally elven. The elves of Great Dale are led by what is known as the <a href="./Council_of_Ancients_and_Elders.html" title="Council of Ancients and Elders" class="page">Council of Ancients and Elders</a>, a respected and honored arrangement that has rarely led the elves astray from a noble path. Though by no means peaceful, the Great Dale is a mystical place of natural wonder stewarded by strong and civil peoples. Power lies in ageless wisdom and honest ways and always commands respect and demands responsibility with the elves, who are careful with their trust and often at risk of becoming insular and isolated from the rest of the Land.
</p>

<p>
Overdale is the largest settlement in the Great Dale, and serves as the capitol of the region and the seat of law. Overdale is where the Council of Ancients and Elders convenes. When gathered together the Council is a guiding force across the Great Dale, but when recalled the Elders are leaders in their own right, and each settlement has its own government and traditions. Overdale in the overgrown heart of the Great Dale is ruled by a <a href="./Triumvirate_of_Paragons.html" title="Triumvirate of Paragons" class="page">Triumvirate of Paragons</a>, who delegate to envoys and managers and lead as part of a royal upper class. Underdale within the wild caverns beneath the surface is managed by elected <a href="./Overseers.html" title="Overseers" class="page">Overseers</a> who handle civil affairs and legislation, and the <a href="./Queen_Serpentine.html" title="Queen Serpentine" class="page">Queen Serpentine</a> and the Underseers who are part of a hereditary noble order and execute the law of the Overseers. Shining on the Sea along the <a href="./Thunderous_Shore.html" title="Thunderous Shore" class="page">Thunderous Shore</a> is governed by the <a href="./Merchant_Marine.html" title="Merchant Marine" class="page">Merchant Marine</a>, a military organization that claims the coastal waters of Great Dale and acts as a guard against the hordes from the nearby fiendhold of <a href="./Demogorr.html" title="Demogorr" class="page">Demogorr</a>. Shadow by the Boughs on the border between the <a href="./The_Balewoods.html" title="Balewoods" class="page">Balewoods</a> and the Great Dale is a partially lawless free market where most of the power is brokered by noble houses and wealthy merchants. 
</p>

<p>
The Great Dale is peopled largely by elves, though many races can find a home within the wilderness. Pure elves totally distinct from a subrace or halfbreed are the dominant race around the region, though the eladrin (high elf), drow (dark elf), and wilden (wood elf) thrive in comparable numbers in each their ancestral homelands. Humans, halfelves, gnomes, halflings, pixies, shifters, changelings, and monstroids and <a href="./Goblinoids.html" title="goblinoids" class="page">goblinoids</a> of most types are all found in the region. Gnomes inhabit the mountains and hills of the forest alongside the rare pixie or halfling. Shifters and changelings are at home with the wilden deep in the forests. Monstroids like kenku, bullywugs, and centaur all call the Great Dale home, and <a href="./Dragons.html" title="dragons" class="page">dragons</a> with their kin have staked claims as well. Civil and mannered goblinoids can be found readily in the cities and villages, and barbarous ones as well spilling from the fiendhold in nearby <a href="./Walmarie.html" title="Walmarie" class="page">Walmarie</a> and from awful places long lost in the <a href="./Subterrania_and_the_Deep_Dark.html" title="Deep Dark" class="page">Deep Dark</a> below the earth.
</p>

<p>
Politically, the divides of the Dales are largely along racial lines when such cracks can be seen. Eladrin and drow battle with each other and the wilden seek only to hone their skill on the victor. Overdale and Underdale are typically locked in dire competition due to their proximity, though the ageless stalemate is proof that each can survive with only their own resources instead of those of their neighbor as well. The real source of the conflict is the distrust and revulsion the eladrin hold for the drow and vice versa. Each sees myriad ill features in the other, a disgust that is sometimes worked into the furor of war when the drow grow too desirous of sun and freedom and the eladrin too covetous of the riches of the deep earth. Currently a strict border has formed at the surface, a bottling-up of drow anger that may soon erupt. Outwardly the constant predations from <a href="./Conqueror's_Road.html" title="Conqueror's Road" class="page">Conqueror's Road</a> and <a href="./Zhin_Zhis.html" title="Zhin Zhis" class="page">Zhin Zhis</a> chip away at the stability of the Dales with plenty of trouble finding its way from the Balewoods and Demogorr, though Walmarie and <a href="./Caracossam.html" title="Caracossam" class="page">Caracossam</a> are usually too distant or self-concerned to have designs on the Dales.
</p>

<p>
Most people of Great Dale subsist on the bounty of the forest. The woods provide supply and sustenance to those who are keen stewards, and it is culturally ingrained that one must only take what they need, and always work to protect the environment for the next harvest. Goods are typically hand-crafted from natural materials of the highest quality by local artisans, but imports are not uncommon, especially with metals which are scarcely available outside Underdale. Many people find work in tending the forest and its fauna and flora, with ranger and druid being common professions. Spellcraft is a respected talent, and even the most isolated of village groves will have a hedge mage or amateur sorceror practicing their craft for the good of their neighbors. Most trade is in the form of barter or good will credit likely to be paid back in service to nature, but coinage is still used in the cities and by foreign merchants who do not take readily to the communal culture.

Myth and Minutiae<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The surface denizens of the Dales have little access to metal resources, and so many of their goods improvise with specially resilient woods or tough scales and thick hides. Enchantment is a common enhancement, and the eladrin of Overdale have perfected magical tempering of the most mundane of materials, elevating them to the levels of mythic metals like orichalcum. Below in Underdale the situation is different. While the drow lack access to the exotic minerals the dwarves of Caracossam use, they have capitalized on access to magically-conducive metals like electrum and rare subterranean crystals and stones. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Overdale and Underdale exist amongst a gargantuan tangle of petrified roots that was said to have fallen from the <a href="./The_Astral_Sea.html" title="Astral Sea" class="page">Astral Sea</a> in an ancient myth. The tangle rests in a crater that bridges the surface to the webs of natural caverns below. The elves have carved their magnificent sister cities into the roots themselves, creating a sprawling society that reaches as far into the heavens as it does below the earth.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Most villages in the Dales are small, only dozens of people. Communities on the surface stay small in order to migrate freely around the forests to avoid overtaxing any one area, and below the surface the tunnels can only house so many people in one area comfortably. Though a great number of people live in Great Dale, crowds are usually found only in the cities or at seasonal gatherings.
